Respected Madam,It is an undeniable fact that parents are the major stakeholders in the functioning of the school. I would like to bring to your attention that the Parents Teacher Association, in schools, plays a potential role in bringing parents and teacher together and to understand each other and cooperate in the task of development of young impressionable minds. The two agencies must make a concerted effort in evolving a conducive atmosphere in school for children to attain their optimum potential. We would like to bring to your notice that on 12th April’2010, D.O.E had issued Guidelines for Constitution of Parents Teachers Association (P.T.A) in Aided / Unaided Schools. Whether any School recognizes or not, Parents are major stakeholders in the functioning of a School. However, Parents of Delhi Public School, Dwarka understand that there were no elections held for section of P.T.A representatives. Our concerns about the existing PTA stem from several factors, including a lack of transparency in decision-making processes, limited parent involvement, and an inadequate representation of diverse perspectives. These issues have resulted in a perceived disconnect between the PTA and the Parents and Teachers, hindering effective collaboration and mutual understanding.\n",
        "Moreover, it has been noticed that the Parent Rep of a particular class is promoted as the parent rep of the subsequent class in the next academic session without any consent, elections, or intimation to rest of the parents. The current practice of PTA had jeopardized the entire purpose for which it was constituted, most of the parents are not even aware who is the PTA of their ward’s class. There is no interaction between parents and PTA taking place which can strengthen the healthy communication amongst teachers and parents for overall development of ward and the school in totality.By initiating a fresh election of PTA members, we aim to provide an opportunity for all interested parents and teachers to actively participate in shaping the future of our school community. This process will enable the elections of PTA representatives who can foster open communication, encourage greater parental involvement, and work collaboratively with the school administration to address the evolving needs and concerns of students, parents, and teachers alike.We are also not sure if the any of the staff member of school are chosen as Parents Rep, if this is the case, it will lose the objective of basic purpose of constituting the Parents Teachers Association The staff members are bound to their Service Rules and have many constraints so many not project Parents point objectively in free and fair manner.Therefore, considering the above, we would like to request you to:\n",
        "i.Dissolve the current unelected PTA with immediate effect. ii.Notify for conducting fresh and new fair and transparent P.T.A elections immediately in the current session before the given deadline. iii.School should notify the elections, personally informing all parents of the date and time through hard copy circulars with acknowledgment receipts for office use and SMS etc. iv.Eligible parents are to be encouraged to file the nominations and should be given enough time to file the nomination.v.One parent representative should not be allowed to continue for two consecutive terms. Since at present, there is a practice to continue the same person as a Parent representative for many years, which has seriously demeaned the main purpose of PTA to work in close coordination with teachers for the overall development of children.vi.One child One vote principle should be adopted. Only one vote for one parent may be verified with the Admission no. of the child.vii.Results may be published online without highlighting the names of parents who participated in elections. So that transparency be ensured.viii.The entire election process should be overlooked by a presiding officer, who can be a nominee from the DOE or any independent government official. ix.The complete elections process must be 100% transparent and elections, counting and declaration of results etc. should be held under the surveillance of a Video Camera. To ensure transparency and fairness, we recommend the formation of an independent election committee comprising both parents and teachers who are not currently associated with the PTA. This committee can oversee the election process, including the nomination of candidates, the dissemination of information, and the conduct of the actual voting.Requesting you to release the notification for free and fair election with immediate effect to ensure the principle of PTA body is exercised in true letter and spirit.\"\"\"\n"
